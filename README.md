## Problem Statement

- **Fraud:**  The current academic credentialing system can be vulnerable to fraud and manipulation.  Fake  degrees or forged marksheets undermine the value of legitimate achievements and harm the reputations of institutions.

- **Inefficiency**:  Manual verification of academic certificates can be a slow, bureaucratic process. This creates time lags for employers making hiring decisions, delays for students who need credentials recognized, and costs institutions significant resources.

- **Lack of Trust**: In a system plagued by potential fraud and slow verification, the authenticity of an individual's qualifications can be questioned. This casts doubt on employers and creates barriers for qualified individuals.

- **Lack of Accessibility**: Not all stakeholders can access credential verification processes equally. Smaller institutions or businesses may not have the resources for robust verification checks,
